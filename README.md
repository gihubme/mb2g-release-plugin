### Workflow

Given we have:

1. Our version model is <MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>, where we will consider Major as an official release, Minor the bugfix fix and Patch any implementation or new feature that should be tested
2. Our production is `prod` branch, and it is used to create official and bugfix releases on packagecloud. Only `dev` can push to `prod`. When changes are committed and pushed, it should trigger circleci build:
   1. with tests
   2. increase snapshot version on `master` and deploy to packagecloud repository with appropriate version
      1. if git commit message contains `[majour]` (0.X.X-SNAPSHOT to 1.0 for release artifact and 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on `master`)
      2. any other case will create major release (0.1.X-SNAPSHOT to 0.2 for release artifact and 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT on `master`)
4. Our git-default is branch `master`, and it is used to integrate new features. When changes are committed and pushed, it should trigger circleci build:
   1. with tests 
   2. increase snapshot version on `master` (0.0.1-SNAPSHOT to 0.0.2-SNAPSHOT)
5. For each feature we have an extra branch that contains word `feature` in its name (feature-Xxx). Before last changes are committed and pushed, the brunch should be rebased on m`master` and new tests should be run locally. When changes are committed and pushed, it should trigger circleci build:
   1. with tests


### Maven Release Plugin

- setting up release-plugin to deploy project snapshots and releases to Packagecloud
- setting up release-plugin and circleci to perform integration-test when circle brunch is updated
- setting up release-plugin and circleci to deploy new releases when master brunch is updated
- adding branch filter to circleci config

### [Running Tests with maven](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1399240/how-do-i-get-my-maven-integration-tests-to-run)

Run below to execute **only Unit Tests** `mvn clean test`

You can execute below command to run the **both unit and integration** `mvn clean verify`

In order to run **only Integration Tests**, follow `mvn failsafe:integration-test`

##### With maven install

In order to **skip unit tests** during mvn install, follow `mvn clean install -DskipUnitTests`

In order to **skip integration tests** during mvn install, follow `mvn clean install -DskipIntegrationTests`

In order to  **skip all tests** during mvn install, follow `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
